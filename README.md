# Malware-detection
In our project, we focused on researching and implementing a script for data extraction from PE files to generate a dataset comprising both infected and clean files. This dataset served as the training data for our machine learning algorithm, specifically the K-nearest neighbors (K-nn) algorithm.

Throughout the project, we thoroughly tested the algorithms using the complete set of dataset features. Notably, we achieved an impressive accuracy rate of over 90% across all the algorithms. Furthermore, by applying a feature selection algorithm to the dataset, we were able to further enhance the accuracy of all the learning algorithms.

I would like to acknowledge the valuable assistance I received from the repository available at https://github.com/tuff96/Malware-detection-using-Machine-Learning/tree/master. This repository provided valuable resources and insights that significantly contributed to the successful implementation of our project. The knowledge and expertise shared by the repository's contributors greatly supported our efforts in the field of malware detection using machine learning.
